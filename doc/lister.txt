INTRODUCTION                                    *lister*

This plugin provides a collection of commands for dealing with Vim's lists.

Each command applies an action over a list. The commands are typically named
in the form :{X}{action}, meaning {action} will be carried out on the list
represented by the single character {X}. For example, |:Qgrep| performs a
grep-like operation over the items in the |quickfix| list (denoted by `Q`).

                                                *lister-list-table*
The following table briefly describes the lists used and the letter that
begins the commands that use them.
